# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose
- The large company has thousands of employees and the baby boomer generation is nearing retirement age. 
- The purpose of the project is to determine how many employees will be retiring soon to make sure the company can handle a lot of position vacancies. 

## Project Overview
- Using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4, I created and filtered tables to determine how many employees are eligible for retirement benefits.
- The results were categorized by department as well as title


### Challenge Overview
- An additional task was to determine employees that were eligible for the company mentorship program instead of going straight into retirement. 
- The data needed to be grouped by title of position, and then filtered for the appropriate age range. 


## Resources
- Data Source: Six Employee Data CSV files
- Software: pgAdmin 4 Version 6.8, PostgreSQL Version 11.16
- MSU Bootcamp Spot Module 7: https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/2508/pages/7-dot-0-1-exploring-databases-with-sql?module_item_id=635439

## Results

### Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- The company will have to prepare to fill many Senior Engineer and Senior Staff roles in the near future.
- They will not have to focus too much on filling positions at the Manager level or the Assistant Engineer level.

### Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
- Based on the data, there is an abundance of eligible employees for the mentorship program for almost every leadership level.
- The mentorship program is designed for employees close to retirement age to take on less of a role while training the incoming leadership employees.

## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
